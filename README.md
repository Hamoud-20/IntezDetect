# IntezDetect
I created a Python tool that uses the Intezer Analyze API to scan files and directories for malware. The tool is easy to use and provides a command line interface for specifying the file or directory to scan. It uses an API key for authentication and supports parallel scanning, progress tracking, and color-coded output for easier analysis.

# Features:
- Scan files and directories for malware using the Intezer Analyze API
- Command line interface for easy usage
- API key authentication for security
- Parallel scanning for faster results
- Progress tracking using the tqdm library
- Results displayed in a pretty table format
- Color-coded output to highlight potential threats
